This folder has the R code (as R markdown), data, and output and some of the data for calculating the fraction of undiagnosed infections per diagnosed cases. 

1. The full description of the analysis is in the `/R/Ratio-CountsV3.Rmd` R markdown file. This file contains text and embedded R code, and when run in Rstudio, it creates the 'output/Ratio-CountsV3.docx' file with the description of the analysis and the results. 

2. The data from the US census is in the /data/ folder, as well as data defining the regions. Within the .Rmd there is data from the output of Figure 3, that is used in the calculation. But the raw data for the 8058 participants in the final data set is not included in the data folder. Therefore the .Rmd cannot be run to produce the output.
