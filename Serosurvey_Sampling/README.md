# Serosurvey_Sampling
 
This serves as a respository of code used to sample a volunteer roster of ~300K to match (as closely as possible) the demographic characteristics captured in the U.S. Census, across 6 categories: Age, Sex, Race, Ethnicity, State, and Urban/Rural environment. Please note that data were obfuscated to ensure sufficient de-identification of volunteers and enrolled individuals. Since files are updated daily, the code and data provided cannot fully replicate the process of identifying the target smaple. We only aim to illustrate how the process was implemented in code. 

See the sampling_strategy_share.Rmd file for complete code and discussion. Supporting de-identified data are provided in the data folder.
