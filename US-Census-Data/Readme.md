This folder contains files to create the US Census data files used in the analysis. 

A description of the source files (including website links) is in USCensusByCounty3.docx. This file was created by the R markdown file `USCensusByCounty3.Rmd`, which contains the R code used to create it. Use Rstudio to look at the file, or any text file reader. The `USCensusByCounty3.Rmd` file creates (when run with R, through Rstudio) the data/Census3AgeGroupsWithNames.csv file.
